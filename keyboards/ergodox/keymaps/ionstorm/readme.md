Firmware fingerspelling and modifier keys, WIP

Disclaimer: I accept no responsibility for brain damaged caused by
reading my scatter-brained source code. Comments that may appear
to explain what I was thinking may actually only be relevant to code
that I deleted because it didn't work.

To try it out, enter bolt/fingerspelling mode with upper-left key of
the right hand.

Hold number bar on the ring finger and fingerspell on the other, or
tap and release to type a single character on either hand (probably
going to change this to a mode lock for this toggle key).
While holding ring finger toggle key, include middle finger number
bar to add shift, inner thumb key to add alt, outer thumb key to add
control.

When I add back the locking function (which has been gone since I
rewrote this because I forgot some important things about how C works
and couldn't debug it for two weeks), the keymap will also let you
alternate hands to type fingerspelled characters. Characters in this
mode are sent when all keys on an individual half of the keyboard are
released, so you can be releasing a chord on one hand while starting
one on the other without stacking issues. That was a problem I kept
having when I tried to type faster using a python dictionary version
of two handed fingerspelling.

For now, fingerspelled characters are sent directly by the Ergodox,
and anything that doesn't meet the criteria to trigger a character
sends a chord using the bolt protocol. Buried deep under the mess
that is this keymap is still a core of the bolt keymap code written
by Jason Green. 
 
Right hand alphabet is just a mirror image of the left hand alphabet.

Letters that have been changed to put the whole alphabet on one hand:
e: PR- or -RP
i: FPR- or -RPL
u: SKW- or -BGS (not sure if that's my final choice for 'u')
space: SP-
enter: STR- (definitely not my final choice, maybe TRA instead?)
period: TPO-
comma: KWO-

The stenodictionary.h file that has all the character translations in
it gets generated by a python script from part of a python dictionary
I gave up on when I realized what I wanted made more sense to do in
firmware (also requires less bizarre chords to avoid conflicts this
way).

Lines 198 through 228 of doublefist.py is basically the
dictionary, along with a few other things added by the script
doublefist_firmware_maker.py.
